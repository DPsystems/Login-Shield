For this version I've made some changes to the IPTABLES command.  This means if you want to implement the new setup you'll need to first delete the 
base iptables rules using the current "set-iptables.sh del" command before using the new set-iptables-config.sh command - renamed to set-iptables.sh after
customization.

Reason - I've added a new prefix to the logging because we have multiple blacklist scripts and want to offer different levels of protection/logging/reporting.
