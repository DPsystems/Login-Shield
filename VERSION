# VERSION HISTORY
# ===============

Version 
        0.10b - 2020-06 - Minor updates and revision of iptables rules and statistic logging

Updated set-iptables.sh to add special log prefix to iptables rules.  We have multiple versions of this
script series coming out for more/less restrictions and want to log the different ipset/iptables rules
differently.  Starting with version 0.10b, a special log prefix will appear in the log files.



	0.01b - 2019-10 - Initial public committed version
        0.02b - 2019-12 - More updates, improved attack_statistics.sh to more accurately retrieve country source
        0.03b - 2020-01 - Minor fixes and continued updating of blacklists



# DEVELOPER NOTES
# ===============

Right now this system is not persistant/permanent.  There are a bunch of features I'd like to 
add to make this more flexible.  Here are future to-do items:

* figure where the standard place to install persistent files should be across all platforms
  (or actually make a real installation script)

* create a host-specific configuration file that will save special changes/exceptions so that
  when the base version is updated, it can inherit local configuration details (like certain
  IP space you want to exempt from the blacklist, and other settings.

* create a system to make the blacklist persistent across reboots - either make it part of
  a persistent IPTABLES/IPSET configuration, or add commands to reset the blacklist when the system
  reboots?

* add additional/optional blacklists - eventually perhaps a more restrictive blacklist of rogue
  IP space that should be blocked on http/s ports as well?

* hear from the community, ways in which this can be improved
