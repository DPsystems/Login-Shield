Your first line of defense against Internet bots, hacks and probes.

A great stand alone filter, or compliment to the wonderful active 
firewall: Fail2Ban, that will make F2B even more efficient.

# WHAT?
# =====

Login-Shield is a set of scripts that implements a traffic filter 
of certain ports commonly probed for system credentials (ftp, ssh,
smtp-auth, etc.).

Our blacklist is intended to be a "wide sweep" IPv4-based blacklist
of major groups of Internet locations that are notorious for housing
the lion's share of compromised computers and servers.  This includes
Chinese, Russian, Korean, South American and other areas.  

This system can by used by itself or (ideally) in association with
more precise anti-hacking systems like Fail2Ban.  With this large
net in place, it reduces the resources Fail2Ban needs to only dealing
with mostly local attacks from IP space you might not want to ban
wholesale.

# WHY?
# ====

Every time a site is compromised, there's a chance lists of usernames
and passwords are leaked.  Hackers will take these lists and try to
find other systems that use these same credentials. If they can gain
access they can completely ruin your day (or year).  They will often
try to login to e-mail clients, ftp accounts, ssh services, etc.  
These system probes are now becoming even more sophisticated, and able
to recognize Fail2Ban trigger conditions and work around them.  Our
system stops approximately 90% of the attacks on most servers.

# HOW?
# ====

Login shield is a very small set of IPTABLES rules that is designed
to block certain ports on common servers, ports that can be used for
user authentication (pop3, imap, ftp, ssh, smtp-auth, etc.)   This system
does NOT by default interfere with web or standard mail delivery.
It's mainly implemented to keep unauthorized IP space from being able
to log in to your server.   Our system uses less than 20k of ram and
is very effective in stopping a huge amount of malicious activity.  It 
also will log attempts so you can monitor blocked traffic in case there
is something legit you need to authorize.
